========

FacetPHP is a small tools framework. The goal of this framework is to provide everyday tools in a clean, consistent, and extensible format.

FacetPHP is currently in alpha and unusable (for it's intended purpose). Please check back periodically and watch the branch for when we go into beta testing.
